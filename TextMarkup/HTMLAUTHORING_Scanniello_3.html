        <summary> A recent survey from data-tracking company <strong>Ensighten</strong> found that <em>46%</em><br />

            <h3>The world’s two largest enterprise blockchain groups join forces </h3>
            The <strong>Enterprise Ethereum Alliance</strong> and <strong>Hyperledger</strong> will combine forces<br />
            to create an open-source, standards-based cross-platform project to<br />
            bring businesses distributed ledger solutions. “At Hyperledger, we’re<br />
            very focused at building communities that build a set of software<br />
            products and many of those touch on and implement <em>Ethereum-related<br />
                standards</em>, and the EEA is focused on driving a community of<br />
            organizations around a common set of standards and then certifying<br />
            applications against those standards,” says <em>EEA Executive Director</em> <strong>Ron Resnick</strong>.
